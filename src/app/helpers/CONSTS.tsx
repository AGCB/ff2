  STORY_START:
    "Once upon a time, in a world not unlike our own, a lone programmer wandered deep into the woods. He did not know how he had come to be here, nor why his feet refused to stop. Some unseen force pulled him forward, past gnarled roots and whispering branches, through shadows that stretched and shifted like living things. The deeper he went, the more the air thickened, humming with something ancient, something watching. His breath came sharp, his fingers twitched as if reaching for a keyboard that was no longer there. But there were no screens here, no lines of code to unravel this mysteryâ€”only the path ahead, carved by hands unseen, guiding him toward a fate unknown.",
